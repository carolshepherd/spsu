As an adjunct instructor and a graduate ( x2) of SPSU I enjoy working with students as they master the technical skills they will need to keep themselves fed in future years. I believe that working code -- deployed and visible to future employers or referral sources -- speaks louder than anything a student can write on a resume. 

In this course, CS 3693, the students worked through a series of architectural prototypes as they marched towards a final product. Over the semester the students learned that large scale application developer is hard stuff. People don't always fulfill their obligations. Loose requirements are a great idea until multiple folks are trying to write code and figure out that each person has a different idea on how the application should work.  Source control -- we used Git -- is a hurdle in a team programming environment and not everyone in the team trusts the process. Deployment, often overlooked until the last minute, is another area that is often glossed over.

Our application was written in Java (instructor's preference -- not the student's). The code is deployed on Amazon Web Services using EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk. We have a servlets running in a web application that launches the java client. The client uses JavaFX to present a graphical user interface that responds to user input and suggestions from the helpful AI process running in the background. High scores are transmitted from the client back to the web server and displayed using AJAX in a set of web pages based on Bootstrap.js. 

We did not design the game mechanics. We based our game on a commercially available game Set (http://www.setgame.com). No effort will be made to commercially develop our version of the game and the source code is openly available at (github).
