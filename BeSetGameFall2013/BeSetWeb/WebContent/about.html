                    <p>I am 22 years old and I am majoring in game design and development at Southern Polytechnic State University. I was born in Maryland and lived there for 5 years. I then moved to Minnesota and lived there for 7 years and finally ended up in Georgia and have lived here for 10 years. I have a strong appreciation for modern pop culture art and music. I am attempting to satisfy my appreciation and desire to be involed with these things by dabbling in everything. I have experience in digital art and music creation. If something catches my attention I will attempt to emulate it at least once.</p>

During this span I worked for the US Navy, GEC Marconi (now BAE), Rockwell Collins, Phoenix Air Group and finally Georgia Tech Research Institute. I reached a point in my career where I needed to complete a degree and choose Computer Science as my major. I enjoy programming and coupled with my electronic experience, computer science is a great pairing to my hardware knowledge. Currently I am a full time student and should graduate from Southern Polytechnic State University (future Kennesaw State University) in the spring of 2015.</p>

                    	<h4>Carol Shepherd</h4>
                        <p>As an adjunct instructor and a graduate ( x2) of SPSU I enjoy working with students as they master the technical skills they will need to keep themselves fed in future years. I believe that working code -- deployed and visible to future employers or referral sources -- speaks louder than anything a student can write on a resume.</p>
                        <p>In this course, CS 3693, the students worked through a series of architectural prototypes as they marched towards a final product. Over the semester the students learned that large scale application developer is hard stuff. People don't always fulfill their obligations. Loose requirements are a great idea until multiple folks are trying to write code and figure out that each person has a different idea on how the application should work. Source control -- we used Git -- is a hurdle in a team programming environment and not everyone in the team trusts the process. Deployment, often overlooked until the last minute, is another area that is often glossed over.</p>
                        <p>Our application was written in Java (instructor's preference -- not the student's). The code is deployed on Amazon Web Services using EC2 and Elastic Beanstalk. We have a servlets running in a web application that launches the java client. The client uses JavaFX to present a graphical user interface that responds to user input and suggestions from the helpful AI process running in the background. High scores are transmitted from the client back to the web server and displayed using AJAX in a set of web pages based on Bootstrap.js.</p>
                        <p>We did not design the game mechanics. We based our game on a commercially available game Set (http://www.setgame.com). No effort will be made to commercially develop our version of the game and the source code is openly available at (github).</p>
